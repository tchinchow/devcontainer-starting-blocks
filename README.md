# git configuration
First and foremost when working with gihub you may want to configure the
username and email when cloning a repository.  
On github, you may want to use the email address that github creates for you
when you choose to keep your personnal email private.  
You can get your _anonymized_ github based email [in your github email settings](https://github.com/settings/emails).

```bash
# modify the commands below to match the values from your github acount.
git config user.email 'github_id+github_username@users.noreply.github.com'
git config user.name 'Your NAME'
```
